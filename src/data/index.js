      "Life is full of challenges and setbacks, and it is easy to feel discouraged and like giving up when faced with these obstacles. However, it is during these tough times that we can rise and prove to ourselves and others that we are capable of overcoming adversity. One key to rising in the face of challenges is to stay positive and keep a growth mindset. This means believing that we can learn and grow from our mistakes and setbacks and that we can improve and succeed. It's important to focus on the progress we have made rather than dwelling on our failures. Ultimately, rising in the face of challenges requires perseverance and hard work. It won’t always be easy, but it will be worth it in the end. By facing our challenges head-on and working towards our goals with determination, we can rise and achieve success."

    content: "Sandeep Jain is the founder of GeeksforGeeks. He completed a bachelor’s degree in Engineering in 2004 and joined MTech at IIT Roorkee in 2005. His platform, GeeksforGeeks is well recognized among all the engineering students throughout all colleges in India and abroad. He loves to solve programming problems in the most efficient ways. Apart from GeeksforGeeks, he has worked with DE Shaw and Co. as a software developer and with JIIT Noida as an assistant professor. Love for teaching led Sandeep Jain to quit his job and start Noida-based GeeksforGeeks, a content platform for developers. Growing up in the city of Firozabad, he had seen really bad quality teaching. He began teaching while he was at school - he used to teach his elder brother. With time, this love for teaching became stronger and stronger. This, along with the poor teaching quality he witnessed, set him on his mission to provide quality education."

Manya was born and raised in Uttar Pradesh in a middle-class family, but thanks to her hard work and passion, she rose through the ranks. In an interview with SheThePeople, Manya opened up about training herself by watching YouTube videos. “I jumped into modeling during my college days. I learned to observe people there. I learned the walk from YouTube and worked hard. I was told to imitate others while walking, but I always have one thing in my mind: never lose yourself. Learn from people, behold yourself and improvise. I always wanted to become a model because I aimed at becoming Miss India,” she said. She is an excellent example of a self-learner. For Manya Singh, being on a platform like Miss India is about honoring and representing every girl from her state, who has dreamt of a successful life."
